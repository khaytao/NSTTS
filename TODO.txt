1. Load a trained Prodiff model in a python file
2. set up a control-net for the model - Follow guide at ControlNet/docs/train.md
3. Set up an audio/prompt dataset
4. Do audio preprocessing - Figure out how to get ControlNet to train on audio files. See Script at ControlNet/tool_add_control.py
5. Do text preprocessing (?)
